# Navigating_agent
This program has an agent who moves in a maze. It will explore the maze looking for gold and then exit the maze. If a square is breezy then it is next to a pit. The agent fails if it falls into a pit. The agent is able to determine which squares are safe as it moves and will visit all safe squares.
